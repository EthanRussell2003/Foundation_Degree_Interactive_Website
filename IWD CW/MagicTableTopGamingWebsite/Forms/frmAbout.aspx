            <img src="Images/where-we-started.jpg" /> Like many other hobby enthusiasts we started from humble beginnings. Playing as a group out of our own houses. <br>

        <div class="right">
            Some of our crew! John on the left. Athena in the middles and Kathy on the right.<img src="Images/Our-crew.jpg" /><br>

        <div class="right">
            Meet our founder, Adrian Richards! He was the one that got the original group together to play and learn together. Often hosting our play groups and other game nights. He also spearheaded the idea to take our love for our hobby to even greater heights! <img src="Images/Our-Founder.jpg" /><br>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
            <img src="Images/where-we-are.jpg" /> And now this is where we're at! Our newly opened store. Using this website we hope to fund upkeep of stock, in store and online and fund events!
